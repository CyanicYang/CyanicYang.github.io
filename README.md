# My Blog Website

### Start Point
        I have owned my own domain name for around half a year now, but never got a
    chance to really set up a blog website myself. I have tried to buy my Raspberry
    Pi for the blog website, but somehow the plan went wrong and at that time I was
    also not very sure of what I should write about.
        Now it has been the third year of my university journey, I have finished 
    most of my university course and still feel like kown nothing about the whole
    computer sciense world(maybe do kown something but still not enough). That's when
    I start to think about I really need a blog website to really record some of my 
    learning process.
        I have lost my passion when buried with endless things to learn.
        I need to reset my "finite state machine" to that start point and try to 
    learn as a total rookie.
